# AFQViz: requirements

Long-term vision: combine with pyAFQ, to provide a full browser-based processing pipeline.

A few features we want in the near future:

- Loading in brain meshes rather than the prespecified one
- Switching the rendering to be different subjects
- Visualizing tract profiles on the rendering of fibers either by coloring them
  or something. We need some way to related the values back to the rendering.
- Selection of sub-samples of participants from a data-base


- Correlation plots: independent variable is a column in the subjects table.
- Split plots (by a categorical variable).
